						<p>DEAR FRIENDS,

   JAI HIND!
						</p>

						<p><img src="images/blog2.jpg" alt=""></p>

						<h2>Large Heading</h2>

						<p>  It is ideas that make history. As the Hegelian adage goes the history is a tough task master. Those who do not learn the lessons of history, history do not forgive them. We also recently learnt the Vedas started with history, science and religion later. Since, however, an idea on the above subject came to our mind, we felt impelled to take up the hardest task.

                  We did not have much occasion to write on Swami Vivekananda, but we have written a number of times on Rabindranath Thakur. Many repetitions on Shri Rabindranath Thakur are therefore bound to come. We would request our esteemed readers to tolerate that.

             It is a well-known story that Narendranath have tested his Guru by putting a coin under the mattress. Paramhansadeva started feeling uncomfortable. As he could not tolerate touch of feeling any coin. Narendranath was testing his guru. Now realising the truth he apologised and took the coin from under the mattress. Swami Paramhansadeva said ‘You have done the correct thing. You must accept any fact only after testing that’. What a truth was told by Paramhansadeva. Narendranath Dutta had followed that up during the rest of his life.
            <b> The first difference between these two great men, who had been the product of the 19th century Bengal Renaissance, is that Rabindranath Thakur was a member of the then ‘Brahmo Samaj,’ where as Swami Vivekananda was a ‘Kayastha Hindu’. Swami Vivekananda was then known as Narendranath Dutta, in Bengal.</b>

          <br>



              The first difference between these two great men, who had been the product of the 19th century Bengal Renaissance, is that Rabindranath Thakur was a member of the then ‘Brahmo Samaj,’ where as Swami Vivekananda was a ‘Kayastha Hindu’. Swami Vivekananda was then known as Narendranath Dutta, in Bengal.

<br>Shri Rabindranath Thakur had written profusely. As we had earlier shared with our esteemed leaders, Thakur had written so profusely that one would not be able to complete reading of his writings in one’s life time. Narendranath Dutta had also written profusely but we are not aware whether he had written anything in Bengali and what his type of writing was. But we are aware of many friends having read all the writings the Swami Vivekananda.

            <br>Swami Vivekananda was and excellent orator. One cannot but remind oneself of Vivekananda’s lectures at the Religious Parliament in Chicago and at many other places. One cannot but refer to his ‘27 Lectures from Colombo to Almora’.  The top cover of the book carries the signature of Swami Vivekananda in English. We are not aware of whether Rabindranath Thakur was such a demagogue or orator. Swami Vivekananda could enliven the participants by such demagogy. His call for “Arise, awake, and stop not till the goal is reached” used to send down a shiver among the members of the audience who felt a tremendous vibration. Rabindranath Thakur was comfortable in both Bengali and English composition.

      <br>Swami Vivekananda has authored many Grantha’s like KARMA YOGA, and RAJA JOGA, and had more than adequate knowledge of Vedas and Upanishad. The epic poem EABAR FIRAO MORE, written by Shri Rabindranath Thakur, who had never gone to school displays more than adequate knowledge of Upanishad and Vedanta. It will be clear when he has written one has to go ahead without fearing death, which is the ultimate reality.

          <br>    Both Rabindranath Thakur and Swami Vivekananda had travelled widely outside India. Narendranath Dutta had walked on feet ‘ASAMUDRA HIMACHAL’(from the Himalayas to Kanyakumari in the Indian Ocean). Rabindranath Thakur had never done that.

    <br>   Rabindranath Thakur had never seen poverty, Narendranath Dutta, after his father’s death, had to struggle hard to support the members of the family. It is also known that as a sanyasin, Naren while at the Baranagar Ashram used to beg alms from door to door in his ‘Langoti’. Rabindranath Thakur had suffered a number of personal tragedies during his life time that spanned over ninety years. His wife is supposed to have committed suicide. We understand he also lost his daughter and some other members of the family. It is said that the sufferings had brought out the best in Rabindranath Thakur. To put this in his immortal words ‘DUKSHYA YADI NA PABE TO, DUKSHYA TOMAR GHUCHBR KABE’

         Rabindranath Thakur had never gone to school; Narendranath Dutta was a highly educated scholar. He was for sometime a student of Calcutta Presidency College. Swami Vivekananda was a bachelor, Shri Rabindranath Thakur was not. Rabindranath Thakur and Swami Vivekananda, who was much younger to Shri Rabindranath Thakur, co-existed but they had never met. We are told Narendranath Dutta was present along with others in some meetings of Rabindranath Thakur but the later did not know Naren.

              Swami Vivekananda has been greatest soul to have ever trotted the mother earth. He was a great Patriot. In the words of Rommand Rolland, ‘Swamiji was a fierce Patriot and a Raja among men.  Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose had said’, if Swami Vivekananda was alive, he would have been at his feet. The best has been said by Shri Rajagopalachari, who had said about Swami Vivekananda’s contribution in the following words, “Swami Vivekananda saved Hinduism and saved India. But for him, we <br>would have lost our religion and would not have gained our freedom.” We, therefore, owe everything to Swami Vivekananda. Rabindranath Thakur was also a great patriot. He gave up his Knighthood immediately after the tragic ‘Jallianwala Bagh massacre’ in Punjab.

Rabindranath Thakur could sing and dance and was also a painter in his late life, Narendranath Dutta is known to have sung Shastriya Sangeet & was fond of Ramprasadi songs and a music lover at large. He also sang Brahmo Sangeet.

  <br>     Shri Rabindranath Thakur had been honored with the Noble Prize, Swami Vivekananda, as we have said earlier, the greatest soul to have aver lived on this earth, was not awarded any such prize. However, the Maharaja of Khetri had given him the name ‘Swami Vivekananda’.

     Swami Vivekananda had swam across the Arabian Sea and sat on top of a rock, which is now called ‘Vivekananda Memorial Rock’. Sitting on Samadhi there, he got the vision that he must attend the Parliament of Religions at Chicago. Vivekananda had no money for under taking the trip by shap. Raja of Khetri financed his trip.
<br>
           As a noted Indian scholar has said, ‘The course of history has changed after Swami Vivekananda’s three speeches on different dates’. According to record, Swami Vivekananda had felt nervous. But remembering his Guru he started in his booming voice, ‘Sisters and Brothers’ of America. The rest is history.

    <br>      The southern part of India has kept alive the memory Swami Vivekananda. Bengal remembers him a little. It is sad not many in north India remember him.

<br>     The body of Shri Rabindranath Thakur was burnt in Calcutta.  Swami Vivekananda when he left his body was burnt at the banks of Ganges at Belurmath.

       Narendranath Dutta had Ramakrishna Paramhansadeva as his Guru. Rabindranath Thakur had no such Guru.

  <br>         Rabindranath Thakur had set up ‘The Shantiniketan’ the abode of piece. Swami Vivekananda had setup  The Belurmath. Not many people are aware that Swami Vivekananda’s main aim to go to the US was to collect money for improving upon the Belurmath. Incidentally, it is perhaps not known to many Swami Vivekananda had gone to the US on the advice of Sarada Ma, the wife of Ramakrishna Paramhansa Deva.

  <br>        Both Rabindranath Thakur and Swami Vivekananda had tremendous respect to women. The former had said that all in his poem, ’NARIR UKTI’. Swamiji is on record to have said what 5 women can do, 100 men cannot. He had seen in the West how enlightened were the women there.

          Swami Vivekananda had a disciple called Sister Nivedita former ‘Margaret Smith’. She turned into a strong revolutionary also. Sister Nivedita later on went to Aravindo Ashram at Pondicherry. As we know, Aravindo was also a great revolutionary.
<br>
           Narendranath Dutta had gone to his Guru Paramhansa Deva and had asked for ‘Mukti, Moksha, Mukti chai’. His Guru scolded him and said ‘TOR ANEK KAAJ AACHHE’. Narendranath Dutta was a very practical man. He is known to have said, “You will reach God with better muscles and biceps than riding Gita”. He had also said “what is needed is the Hindu Mind and a Muslim Body”.

  <br>    There are number of accounts on the power of concentration on the part of swami Vivekananda. We are not aware of any such thing on the part of Rabindranath Thakur.

  <br>    Rabindranath Thakur could lecture, compose poems and essays. He could sing, take part in theatre and dance.

<br>Rabindranath Thakur is known to have said ‘BAIRAGYA SADHANE MUKTI SE AMAR NOY, MANOBER MAJHE AAMI BACHIBARE CHAI’.

    <br>        Similarly, Naren had gone to his guru, seeking Moksha. Paramhansa rebuked him saying ‘JAA TOR ANEK KAAJ KARAR AACHHE’. Indeed,
<br>
          Swami Vivekananda, as Shri Rajagopalachari had said, Swami Vivekananda had saved India and Hinduism.

  <br>     Much more could have been written on these too great men of history but mail has already become lengthy. We beg apology from our esteemed leaders for this.
<br>
        Incidentally, there is no main road in Delhi after the name of Swami Vivekananda, the greatest man of history. What a pity is this! Cannot not this be done?, when the incumbent Prime Minister has quite rightly changed the name of Prime Minister’s residence at 7, Race Course Road to, ‘JANAKALYAN PATH’.

    <br>      Swami Vivekananda was once attack by a group of monkeys. He was trying to seve himself by running away from the scene. Someone advised him ‘DO NOT RUN AWAY, FACE THE BRUTES FACE TO FACE’. They would them run away. Swami Vivekananda did so and the monkeys vanished. He remembered this lession. And when in his latter life faced lot of problems, he had the courage to protect himself. Swami Vivekananda had faced a lot of difficulties but had also say one master the courage to protect oneself by all means and do not run away. Shri Rabindranath Thakur did not have any such occasion. Thus there have been no such similarities between Rabindranath Thakur and Swami Vivekananda.

           Swami Vivekananda had tremendous patience to have overcome a lot of personal difficulties. Shri Rabindranath Thakur had also said ‘KSHMA KARO DHAIRJYA DHARO’.

    <br>      We are sure you would all join us in saying BHARAT AABAR JAGAT SABHAY SHRESTHA AASAN LABEY. We firmly believe the prediction of Swami Vivekananda and what Shri Rabindranath Thakur has said, ‘BHARAT AABAR JAGAT SABHAY SHRESTHA AASAN LABEY’. Both Rabindranath and Swami Vivekananda believed in assimilation and synthesis. Swami Vivekananda in his final message at Chicago on September 27, 1893, had underlined: ‘Upon the banner of every religion will soon be written, in spite of resistance: ‘HELP AND NOT FIGHT’, “ASSIMILATION AND NOT DESTRUCTION’, ’HARMONY AND PEACE AND NOT DISSENSION’.

          Incidentally, while Rabindranath Thakur had said ‘SAK, HUN, DAL, PATHAN, MOGHUL, EK DEHE HOLO LIN’, Swami Vivekananda had also said India had given shelters to all persecuted persons like Jews, Muslims, Persians, Christian, Zoroastrians etc.

            </p>

						<blockquote><p>
                  That meant both Rabindranath Thakur and Swami Vivekananda believed in ‘SHARVEY DHARMA SAMANNYE’. That is India’s culture.

                       Well, Friends, Swami Vivekananda had made 3 predictions after his arrival at Colombo, one of which was India will once again reach the top of the comity of nations. Rabindranath Thakur had also in his immortal words had said BHARAT AABAR JAGAT SABHAY SHRESTHA AASAN LABEY.</p></blockquote>
